      <p>
        I drove up to the Red Lake County, Minn., courthouse not knowing exactly
        what to expect. This was, after all, the seat of the county that I had
        just a few days ago proclaimed, in a story, the "absolute worst place to
        live in America." Residents had been outraged. A county commissioner
        told the state's largest newspaper I could kiss his butt. Would I be
        arrested? Beat? Flogged with a hotdish?
      </p>
      <p>
        But what greeted me instead last week was pure spectacle. A drum line
        from nearby Lafayette High School performed a routine on the courthouse
        steps. Officials and county residents, beaming and full of civic pride,
        lined up to shake my hand and welcome me to their home. And a gaggle of
        local press was there, cameras rolling, to cover it all.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a reporter, I'm used to folks disagreeing with me, especially when
        covering contentious topics like guns, gay marriage and drug policy. But
        until I wrote about the U.S. Department of Agriculture's natural
        amenities index -- which rates and ranks counties on measures of scenery
        and climate -- I had never been disagreed with so much.
      </p>
      <p>And so politely.</p>

      <p>
        Minnesota, you see, ended up looking less-than-great in the USDA's
        ranking. And the state's Red Lake County, five hours northwest of
        Minneapolis in the flat fertile basin of the Red River valley, came in
        dead-last in the nation. The summers are hot, the winters are cold, and
        there aren't any actual lakes in the county -- all of which contribute
        to a low score by the USDA's criteria.
      </p>
      <p>
        Could it really be that bad? I had to find out. At the invite of local
        businessman Jason Brumwell (The Post paid), I took a trip up there last
        week to see the truth behind the numbers. I wanted to find out what life
        in America's worst county was really like.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some county residents were hurt and even angered by their last-place
        ranking. But not Brumwell. He's a relentlessly positive guy who keeps a
        beat-up copy of "The 2,548 Best Things Anybody Ever Said" in the back of
        his beat-up Buick LaCrosse.
      </p>
      <p>
        Where others saw a slight, Brumwell saw an opportunity. With his father
        and two of his siblings, he operates Voyageur's View Camping & Tubing on
        Red Lake River. "My family gets to spend our days listening to people
        from all over the United States and the world tell us how beautiful our
        area is," he says.
      </p>
      <p>
        Brumwell welcomed the media attention the county's last-place ranking
        brought, and encouraged other businesses to do the same. My original
        story hadn't quite framed it this way, but some locals took it to mean
        that we called their county ugly. So, soon after my article went up,
        restaurants and bars began offering specials on "ugly burgers" and "ugly
        wings." Officials in Red Lake Falls, the county's largest town, with a
        population of 1,410, floated the idea of renaming next year's Summerfest
        the "Uglyfest."
      </p>
      <p>
        When I arrived at the county courthouse, Red Lake Falls mayor Kevin
        Harmoning, who also runs a modular home manufacturer in town, took me
        inside for some initial introductions. The biggest headache in a town
        like Red Lake Falls? "Making ends meet," he says, referring to keeping
        the town running, the bills paid and the lights on.
      </p>

      <p>
        During the recession, they had actually been forced to turn some of the
        street lights off to keep everything else running, city administrator
        Kathleen Schmitz said. But all in all, the downturn's effects hadn't
        been as harsh here as elsewhere. Many of the farms outside of town that
        form the economic backbone of the county weren't affected much at all.
        "People still needed to eat," Schmitz said.
      </p>

      <p>
        From the courthouse, Brumwell piled a group of us into a bright red
        roofless tour bus and took us to a dairy farm outside of town owned by
        brothers Carl and Joe Schindler. They milk about 120 cows 12 at a time
        the old-fashioned way, with a simple pump system installed in their
        dairy barn.
      </p>

        <h2>Voting with their feet</h2>
        <p>
          The argument can be made that the most desirable places to live are the places
          where people actually choose to live. We can therefore order couties
          by their population growth based on the latest census data gathered.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h5 class="chart-title">
          Top 10 counties by percent change in population
        </h5>
        <h6 class="chart-subtitle">2010 - 2020</h6>
        <div id="pop_growth_bar_1"></div>
        <p>
          However, short-term factors can skew these results. Many of the
          fastest growing counties are oil towns that benefitted from the shale
          oil boom in the past decade.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h5 class="chart-title">Percent change across 2 decades</h5>
        <div id="pop_growth_scatter_1"></div>
        <p>
          You can see that many of the top performers in the last decade did not
          fare as well in the previous decade. To better compare across time, I
          have devised the N8 index whereby the the percent change in each of the past 3
          decades are multiplied. To avoid sign flipping, the 
          N8 index omits counties that have decades of growth and shrinkage.

      <p>
        The visit was a shot of pure country. A newborn calf suckled my thumb as
        the brothers told me about life on the farm. The earthy smells of a
        dairy operation -- manure and hay and sawdust and dirt -- hung thick in
        the air. It sure didn't seem like the worst place in America -- or one
        particularly lacking in natural amenities, or natural beauty, either. In
        the course of my visit, I learned how crucial farming is to the local
        economy. The wheat harvest had just wrapped up, leaving fields of golden
        stubble behind, but fourth-generation farmer Alex Yaggie, 27, showed me
        the cockpit of one of his 40-foot combines and let me drive it around an
        empty lot as much as I dared.
      </p>

      <p>
        Agriculture directly or indirectly supports a lot of economic activity
        in the county. And the small-town narrative we're all used to hearing --
        of boom and decline, of good jobs leaving for overseas and Main Streets
        hollowed out by relentlessly low prices -- doesn't really seem to apply
        here. Harmoning's manufacturing plant was a hum of activity the day I
        visited, with home components in varying stages of construction moving
        along the quarter mile-long rail line that cranks out a completed house,
        ready for shipping, once every 10 hours.
      </p>

      <p>
        The economic opportunity is a big reason many people stay, and some
        others who left eventually make their way back here. County resident
        Justin Carriere came back to the area after an eight-year stint as an
        investment banker in New York City. He's an avid fisherman and makes a
        lightly-breaded fried walleye that will knock your socks off. Having
        grown up in the area and then experienced the frantic chaos of the
        financial crisis first-hand, he started hankering for home. He moved
        back and took a job at a bank in town.
      </p>

      <p>
        "You just know that there was an easier way to go about things," he told
        me at a meet-and-greet later in the day with county residents at TNJ's
        Bar & Grill in Red Lake Falls. His commute now is a whole lot shorter
        and less hectic. And it's easier to talk to people. "You can strike up a
        conversation with just about anyone you meet," he said.
      </p>
      <p>
        The folks at TNJ's were certainly eager to talk to an out-of-town
        reporter, and tell him what made their community so special. Al Buse,
        for instance, is Red Lake Falls' oldest resident at 101 -- "like
        everyone's grandpa," Jason Brumwell told me. He still lives alone, and
        every morning he loads his tools in the back of his bright yellow golf
        cart and makes his way through town, fixing things that need fixing.
      </p>

      <p>
        Al helped himself to my fries as I chatted him up over a dinner of "ugly
        burger" (double-decker burger and fried egg on toasted wheat). He told
        me about his stint with the Marines during World War II, and how he had
        watched the Enola Gay take off on its fateful flight to Hiroshima. I
        asked him what his secret to long life was. He said it was the wrong
        question. "I would recommend that you don't live past 80," he said.
        "This 100 business is the worst."
      </p>
      <p>
        For dessert, TNJ's served a cake built as a map of the county by baking
        prodigy Matt Weiss, a student at a local high school. It was by far rtge
        finest work of cake-based cartography I have ever seen. I don't expect
        to encounter its equal even if I live as long as Al Buse.
      </p>
      <p>
        Education is big in the county. Despite a population of only 4,000, the
        county supports two elementary schools and two high schools. Each of the
        high schools graduates roughly two dozen students each year, and even
        the county's poor have a remarkably good shot of becoming middle class
        later in life, according to a 2013 study by Harvard's Equality of
        Opportunity Project.
      </p>
      <p>
        In fact, by most economic metrics, the county looks pretty good. The
        unadjusted employment rate in July was 4.6 percent, well below the
        national average. The median household income is $48,000, while the
        median home value is about $89,000, according to the U.S. Census. The
        poverty rate is 11.9 percent, below the U.S. average of 15.4 percent.
        One reason I suspect the outcry against my article was so strong is that
        Minnesotans aren't used to being ranked low on anything.
      </p>
      <p>
        I spent the night at the Chateau Motel & Liquor Store, which is a
        brilliant business idea that absolutely needs to come east. The
        accommodations were nice, but what I found most striking is how friendly
        everyone I'd met had been. They were fiercely proud of their community
        in a way I'd never seen before -- not even during my childhood in
        small-town upstate New York. "We don't welcome people like this when
        they come to D.C.," I kept saying to people, dumbfounded.
      </p>
      <p>
        The next day, Burwell planned a whirlwind tour of the county on a bus
        with a sign that read "Welcome To America's Worst Tour." We saw the
        county's largest asparagus farm and sampled some amazing pickled
        asparagus with cayenne pepper.
      </p>
      <p>
        When we stopped for lunch -- fried cheese curds and a "Minnesota burger"
        -- at TJ's Tavern in the town of Oklee (pop. 429), U.S. Rep. Collin
        Peterson (D-Minn.) swung by and sang an ode to ugliness on the bar's
        main stage. A savvy politician, Peterson "just happened" to have a
        handful of guitar picks in his pocket.
      </p>
      <p>
        Peterson's a Democratic representative in a largely Republican district.
        But most folks I talked to didn't give much thought to politics, or
        think too highly of politicians, at least at the national level.
        Residents aren't particularly ideological. The county voted for Bill
        Clinton in 1992 and 1996, George W. Bush in 2000 and 2004, Barack Obama
        in 2008, and Mitt Romney, narrowly, in 2012.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gun culture is strong in the region. With some consternation, given my
        recent article, I learned that Chuck Simpson, the county commissioner
        interviewed by the Minneapolis Star-Tribune, would be giving me a tour
        of the Plummer Area Sportsman Club's shooting range. But Chuck was
        gracious about it, and we made amends as he told me about how residents
        banded together to raise funds and build the shooting range when there
        was a need for it. (I didn't actually do any shooting.)
      </p>
      <p>
        It's a point of pride in the county that when residents need to get
        something done, they often simply do it themselves. Residents raised the
        funds to build Red Lake Falls' municipal swimming pool on their own,
        dollar-by-dollar. When the nearby town of Brooks needed a community
        center, businesses donated funds and residents volunteered time to build
        it by hand.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over and over, the folks I spoke with told me it was that sense of
        community that kept them here, and that contributed to that enormous
        outpouring of civic pride in response to my original article. "There's
        lots of freedom here," Jason Brumwell said. "But everybody's still
        watching out for each other."
      </p>
      <p>
        The people were amazing. "Minnesota Nice," as it's called, is a
        verifiable phenomenon. But even going beyond the civic pride that was so
        thick you could season a fried walleye with it, there was the landscape.
      </p>

      <figure>
        <img src="./images/scenic.jpg" style="width: 600px" />
        <figcaption>
          Chris was ruthlessly abandoned on his kayaking trip.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        The high point of the tour for me was a kayak trip down Red Lake River,
        which meanders through the county before meeting with Clearwater River
        in Red Lake Falls and eventually emptying into the Red River along the
        Minnesota-North Dakota border
      </p>
      <p>
        The river was a ribbon of tranquility slicing through the green-gold
        late August landscape. Broad and flat, but with just enough elevation
        drop to keep things interesting for this novice kayaker, the river
        carried a group of us smoothly through the pylons of a defunct railroad
        trestle and downstream toward sandy bluffs that rose 50 or so feet above
        the banks.
      </p>
      <p>
        Locals fish the river for bass and walleye in the summer. When it
        freezes in the winter (average low temperature in January: -4 degrees),
        they make the best of it by skiing and skating across its surface. I
        began to understand what schoolteacher Bobbi Aakhus had said to me at
        the meet-and-greet at T&J's. "There's so much to do here," she said.
        "You just have to really dig into it."
      </p>
      <p>
        Before visiting, I wouldn't have believed her. I was worried that 36
        hours would be too long a visit, that we'd run out of things to say or
        do and end up sitting in silence, staring at corn. But I left feeling
        like I'd barely scratched the surface of all there is to see and know
        about the county and the people who call it home.
      </p>
      <p>
        I kept looking for signs of discord or trouble, cracks in the facade of
        Minnesota Nice. But I couldn't find any. The places I visited, from the
        bars to the barns to the warehouses, even smelled wholesome -- like wood
        and grain and prairie air.
      </p>
      <p>
        There's perhaps something amiss in a ranking that places Red Lake County
        at the absolute bottom of the nation when it comes to scenery and
        climate. As I noted in my original story, the USDA's index places a lot
        of emphasis on mild weather and a little less on true scenic beauty,
        which of course is harder to quantify. But there's no doubt that the Red
        Lake County region is flat-out gorgeous. In a phone interview, Minnesota
        Sen. Amy Klobuchar called it a "stark beauty," and I think she's right.
        And you can see that beauty everywhere, from the open farm country to
        the craggy bluffs and hills of the river valley.
      </p>
      <p>
        When people and places halfway across the country are just a mouse-click
        away on your computer, it's easy to assume that the we live in a nation
        made small and manageable by technology. But traveling to a place like
        Red Lake County, hours away from any major metro area, is a reminder
        that in much of the country, the rhythms of daily life are, still,
        markedly different than the coastal city grind of long commutes and
        high-octane jobs.
      </p>
      <p>
        For some of us, it takes a place as small as Red Lake County to drive
        home just how big this country really is.
